## Overview


XGrammar is an open-source library for efficient, flexible, and portable structured generation.
It supports general context-free grammar to enable a broad range of structures while bringing careful system optimizations to enable fast executions.
XGrammar features a minimal and portable C++ backend that can be easily integrated into multiple environments and frameworks,
and is co-designed with the LLM inference engine and enables zero-overhead structured generation in LLM inference.
