/*!
 * \brief This class stores the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar.
 * The BNF definition here is standard BNF, and the characters are represented using regex-style
 * character classes (e.g. [a-z], [^a-z]).
 *
 * \details
 * ### Rules
 * The BNF grammar AST consists of a set of rules. Each rule contains a name and a definition, and
 * corresponds to a production in the grammar. The definition of a rule is a RuleExpr. Each rule
 * has a rule_id for reference.
 *
 * ### RuleExprs
 * RuleExpr is the definition of a rule or part of the definition of a rule. It can contain
 * elements, empty string, reference to other RuleExprs, or reference to other rules. Each RuleExpr
 * corresponds to an rule_expr_id for reference.
 *
 * For example, in the following rule: rule ::= ("a" "b") | "c"
 * ("a" "b"), "c", ("a" "b") | "c" are all RuleExprs.
 *
 * #### Types of RuleExprs
 * Every RuleExpr is represented by a type as well as a variable-length array containing its data.
 * RuleExpr has several types:
 * - Byte string: a string of bytes (0~255). Supports UTF-8 strings.
 * - Character class: a range of characters (each character is a unicode codepoint), e.g. [a-z],
 *   [ac-z]. Can be negated: [^a-z], [^ac-z]. Now only ascii chars is allowed in [], but this
 *   expression can accept/reject unicode chars.
 * - Character class star: a star quantifier of a character class. e.g. [a-z]*, [^a-z]*.
 * - EmptyStr: an empty string, i.e. ""
 * - Rule reference: a reference to another rule
 * - Sequence: a sequence of rule_exprs, e.g. ("a" "b"). These rule_exprs are concatenated together.
 * - Choices: a choice of rule_exprs, e.g. ("a" "b") | "c". Each rule_expr can be matched.
 *
 * #### Storage of RuleExprs
 * Each type of RuleExpr has a different data format. For the format of each type of RuleExpr, see
 * docs in Grammar::Impl::RuleExprType.
 *
 * We store all RuleExprs in csr_matrix style. That is, they are stored consecutively in one vector
 * (data vector) and the starting position of each RuleExpr is recorded in the indptr vector.
 *
 * \remark The character class star RuleExpr is for the special support for elements like [a-z]*
 * in the grammar. We add it to make the matching more efficient, as we can avoid recursion into
 * rules when matching a sequence of characters. It should be used like:
 * rule1 ::= ((element1 element2 rule2 ...) | ...)
 * rule2 ::= character_class_star_rule_expr(id_of_a_character_class_rule_expr)

   * \param indent The number of spaces for indentation. If set to std::nullopt, the output will be
   * in one line. Default: 2.
   * \param separators Two separators used in the schema: comma and colon. Examples: {",", ":"},
   * {", ", ": "}. If std::nullopt, the default separators will be used: {",", ": "} when the
   * indent is not nullopt, and {", ", ": "} otherwise. This follows the convention in python
   * json.dumps(). Default: std::nullopt.
   * \param strict_mode Whether to use strict mode. In strict mode, the generated grammar will not
   * allow properties and items that is not specified in the schema. This is equivalent to
   * setting unevaluatedProperties and unevaluatedItems to false.
   *
   * This helps LLM to generate accurate output in the grammar-guided generation with JSON
   * schema. Default: true.
